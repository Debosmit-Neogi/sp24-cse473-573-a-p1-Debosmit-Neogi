# SP24 CSE 473/573 3D Geometry Project 1

The following commands should be executed in the root folder of the project.

## Task 1 testing

```bash
python task1.py --alpha 45 --beta 30 --gamma 50
```

## Task 2 testing

```bash
python task2.py
```

## Pack your submission

Note that when packing your submission, the script would run your code before packing.

```bash
sh pack_submission.sh <Your_UBIT_name>
```
Change **<Your_UBIT_name>** with your UBIT name.
The resulting zip file should be named **"submission\_<Your_UBIT_name>.zip"**, and it should contain 3 files, named **"result_task1.json"**, **"result_task2.json,"**, and **"UB\_Geometry"**. If not, there is something wrong with your code/filename, please go back and check.

Submision:
1. You should only submit the zip file to UBLearns - Assignments - Project1
2. You should push your latest code file - geometry.py to your classroom repository.
